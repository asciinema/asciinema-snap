summary: Record and share your terminal sessions, the right way
description: |
  Forget screen recording apps and blurry video. Enjoy a lightweight, purely
  text-based approach to terminal recording.

  Record right where you work - in a terminal. To start just run 'asciinema
  rec', to finish hit Ctrl-D or type exit. Any time you see a command you
  want like to try in your own terminal just pause the player and copy-paste
  the content you want. It's just a text after all! Easily embed an
  asciicast player in your blog post, project documentation page or in your
  conference talk slides.
